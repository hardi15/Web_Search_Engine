really
wanting
to
know
who
was
out
Who
are
the
Black
photographers
that
I
could
that
I
could
work
with
to
tell
amazing
And
so
for
I
wanted
to
make
the
Ebony
and
Jet
of
Nothing
but
Black
photographers
doing
nothing
but
Black
And
so
for
one
of
the
big
things
that
seen
over
over
my
time
of
being
a
photo
editor
is
that
everyone
always
we
know
where
to
find

know
where
to
find
their
And
here
You

You
say

find
because
I
put
it
in
this
beautifully
neat
package
with
a
bow
on
it
and
delivered
it
to
your
Jillian
Having
the
platform
that
I
have
and
not
doing
something
really
bothered
So
I
was
gonna
take
this
as
you
like
in
this
moment
right
So
I
sat
with
and
what
can
I
How
can
I
get
all
these
people
I
I
personally
know
a
lot
of
one
being
who
was
for
working
at
a
place
because
I
access
One
out
of
five
people
have
a
disability
so
a
huge
majority
of
people
that
not
I
was
need
to
find
a
place
where
I
can
not
only
show
other
disabled
folks
that
not
that
there
is
a
community
out
specifically
in
their
field
of
what
they
love
to
but
brands
and
companies
to
know
that
there
is
a
lot
of
us
out
there
who
are
willing
and
ready
and
available
to
work
long
to
put
the

discussion
about
Hire
Black
And
tonight
we
have
Jillian
a
model
turned
And
we
have
with
us
Brent
who
has
started
his
own
website
to
profile
and
encourage
people
hiring
Black
I
want
to
talk
you
your
bringing
voice
and
visibility
to
these
Black
photographers
who
have
been
around
for
a
not
like
this
is
a
new
thing
that
Black
photographers
just
So
where
do
you
feel
that
we
are
at
as
artists
as
your
medium
of
Brent
So
Diversify
started
from
literally
a
me
really
wanting
to
know
who
was
out
Who
are
the
Black
photographers
that
I
could
that
I
could
work
with
to

And
so
for
me
I
wanted
to
make
Ebony
and
Jet
of
Nothing
but
Black
photographers
doing
nothing
but

And
so
for
one
of
the
big
things
that
seen
over
my
time
of
being
a
photo
editor
is
that
everyone

we
know
where

I
personally

for

For
everything

I
pulled

from

actually

did

who
were

What
does
disability
justice
mean
to
Stacey
Park
this
kind
of
growing
framework
about
looking
at
the
ways
disability
connects
with
other
And
when
really
able
to
stretch
it
out
to
what

people
need
to
be
who
they
creating
a
world
where
everybody
can
really
participate
disability
justice
really
pushes
that
Stacey
she
was
a
huge
dreamer
in
championing
justice

those
that
are
often

My
name
is
Stacey
I
study
political
and
always
been
really
interested
in
social
justice
Stacey
started
in
disability
related
work
when
she
was
very
young
in
the
state
of
North
She
actually
worked
to
pass
a
law
to
ensure
that
disability
history
is
taught
in
She
had
a
you
active
on
social
media
working
to
educate

people
that

need

I
also
asked
Andraea
for
little
tidbits
about

one
of
my
favorite
was
that
she
was
always
putting

truly
a

Stacey
and
I
met
formally
I
knew
of
her
for
many
with
her
being
a
pioneer
around
disability
justice
and
which
centers
the
experiences
of
disabled
people
of

who
often
are
experiencing

as
a

was

the

shows
a
little

in
